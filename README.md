I took the Machine Learning for public policy course and I see this class as a continuation of that effort. I am taking this class for the following reasons:
Get more familiar and comfortable with Python and coding.
Improve my data analysis, interpretation and visualisation skills.
Explore ways that I contribute to urban development, resilience and policy solutions
